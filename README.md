# NYC-Taxi-Data-Analysis
Analysis of NYC Inhabitants behavior based on Taxi Data using Apache Spark.

We want to know where people in NYC go on Sundays mornings between (8 am and 11:00 am) comparing to other days of the week. 

We will use the <a href="https://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/">NYC Taxi dataset</a> to analyse people movements, and the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap dataset</a> to compute the closest point of interest.
